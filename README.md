# This is my Timestamp Microservices Back-end project
------------

You could check out this project at the link: https://timestamp-microservice-demo.glitch.me/

### On the front-end,
- edit `views/index.html` and `views/style.css`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

### On the back-end,
- my app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
